  POLITICS_TRACZ_DESC:0 "Once, Tracz masterfully defeated the farmer from Tulczyn, Zenon Walencik, who did not want to sell him his land, because it was his 'small fatherland' and his family lived there for centuries. In his intricate plan, he reported to him to the state administration that he had illegally cut down trees on his field, which was true. They fined Walencik so much, that he did not get up. As a result, the land and the cottage went to a bailiff's auction, the whole village under the leadership of priest Antoni collected money to pay the fines so the land would not be taken away. Nobody knew that it was the work of Janusz Tracz, who had outbidded the offer, got what he wanted, and opened a brothel in Walencik's house gratefully named "Ojcowizna" in order to ultimately humiliate the defiant farmer. This is how Tracz Janusz, the blackest villain of Polish series, razed his enemies to the ground. A man named Waldemar Jaroszy can only clean his shoes."
