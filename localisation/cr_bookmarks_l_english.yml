 CGATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Western Sunshine"
 CGATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. The ceasefire in Greenland is very fragile, and provocations are staged by Humsin everyday. In the north, the Anti-Flower Hill Alliance made their move and took Squirrels Village without response from Flower Hill. Finally, the rule of king of Central Kingdom, Stephen I, is coming to an end. The only peaceful place now seems to be EverRealm, but in such global circumstances, this is also unsure."
 MAI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "King Stephen I ruled the Kingdom for many, many years, his biggest achievements being maintaining peaceful relations with the neighbors and surveying the Entrance to EverRealm. Recently, doctors discovered that the king is deathly ill, and is due to die very soon.\n\nThere is only one heir to the throne - Macius, who is 8 years old."
 GRN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Greenland is not enjoying it's current situation - despite somewhat peaceful relations with Iceworld, the much bigger threat is located on the former, southern lands of Greenland - the empire of Humsin. The lord of sand constantly stages situations to provoke the Crown Prince of Greenland, Tabaluga, the Last Dragon, to declare war on him. However, the young dragon doesn't fall for these attempts, and something like ceasefire still exists between Greenland and Desert.\n\nBut the question is not 'if' it will stand. The question is 'how long it will stand?'"
 ICW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Greenland Treaty some years ago, Iceworld was shrinked to one ice field and its capital, Glasstown. The country suffered biggest possible defeat under regime of Arktos in its history. However, the Lord of Ice - as the snowman entitles himself - is searching new ways to regain lost territories and bring back Iceworld's glory. Even, if it means allying with his archenemy no. 2, Humsin, for greater good - to get rid of Tabaluga. Once and for all."
 FRI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Friedewalt's Kingdom is enjoying its golden age: recent progress with colonization, new trade treaties and normalization in relations with Central Kingdom paid off. More new colonies are planned to be funded, and wealth is expected to grow with them.\n\nHowever, there is one thing - Friedewalt is ageing. It wouldn't be so dangerous, if his son, and thus Crown Prince, Hartmut, wasn't such unpredictable person as he is now."
 ENC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Peace rules Enchancia, together with king Roland II, and whole EverRealm. The kingdom is currently preparing to modernize itself to met modern standards; rest of EverRealm is expected to follow suit soon after. The Winslow Royal Family is loved by every citizen of the country, and thousands appear where even a single prince shows up. It seems that nothing will stop current prosperity era and golden age of Enchancia."
 FLO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Flower Hill stands in troubles. Squirrels' Village has been taken by Wolves, and many fled the country to the east, creating rump states. It seemed that age of Flower Hill is ending.\n\nHowever, the Military Council, which rules the country after the previous war with Wolves, decided that it is time to elect Supreme Leader of Flower Hill, who will lead the country into greatness once again."
 TSA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Tri-State Area, being located on important crossing between seas, enjoys its prosperity era. Traffic going through Danville Canal gives enormous income, and the leadership even began thinking about going the same path as king Friedewalt went and colonize some lands.\n\nHowever, the term of current President, Roger Doofenshmirtz, is ending fall 1936, and his brother Heinz is rumoured to run for the office..."
 GON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Lord Shen changed the country of his ancestors into bloody dictatorship. Many had fled across Greenland Bay before the borders and ports were closed. Those who stayed, are forced to be fully loyal to the new ruler of Gongmen.\n\nEvil lord has plans of conquering whole Eastern Continent, however there are other countries, that are quite the danger to him, and will interrupt any of his plans..."
 DES_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Humsin fortified his position after taking over much of Greenland some time ago. Now, stuck between remnants of glorious realm that repelled many attacks of Arktos on the north and the Sioux on the south, the undefeated ruler of the Desert aims to conquer not only Greenland, but every country on the world that stands in his way..."
 DUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After futile efforts to have his country included into EverRealm, Lord Farquaad began hating everything that spins around any fairytale. The efforts to break into EverRealm will continue; any occasion to do so will be valuable as hell.\n\nAnd when EverRealm Gate falls under the boot of Farquaad, the whole world will be under danger..."
 JPN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japanifornian Republic stands firmly after 20 years of being independent - this would be the first thought of a person that came to the country and saw the situation. However, it's only an illusion.\n\nJapanifornian executive power is being overseen by Bar Association, which also oversees lawyers in the country. This creates very dangerous situation, where instead of trias politica model, there are only two branches of power.\n\nAnyway, new presidental elections are coming near, and in case of one of the candidates, they are not going to be so easy because of his past troubling him..."
 LEC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After War of 1912, Lechina Empire has been drastically robbed from many of its lands, which today belong to the three republics, which are also eastern neighbours. The earthquake, that was caused by the Treaty of 1916, lasts till today, and King Lech I the Great needs to address this issue quickly, or the country will collapse into a civil war without end..."
 AVA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Princess Elena, after overthrowing Shuriki from the throne, can finally prepare to be the Queen of Avalor. However, the rule of the evil sorceress left severe impact on the kingdom, with bills and laws trashing tradition and forbidding any magic in the Kingdom, that is home of all magic in EverRealm.\n\nOnly time will tell, if Elena is actually up to the challenge, or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC_TCW:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by Wars of 1910s, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
