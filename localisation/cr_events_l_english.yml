    centralkingdom.30.d:0 "After the Children Parliament has been created in Central Kingdom, this... thing... spreads like a venom. Children in our kingdom also start to demand that such parliament should be created here as soon as possible.

    centralkingdom.32.b:0 "Well, these are his toys. We won't interfere with them."
    centralkingdom.33.t:0 "Macius agrees to the ultimatum"
    centralkingdom.33.d:0 "Finally, a reply came from Lubniewice.\n\nMacius accepted our ultimatum, saying, that the Parliament needed reforms anyway."
    centralkingdom.33.a:0 "It ain't much, but it's honest work."
    centralkingdom.33.b:0 "I don't care if he agrees or not, I just hate him."
    centralkingdom.34.t:0 "Central Kingdom proposes us a pact"
    centralkingdom.34.d:0 "A note has come from king Macius. He proposes a diplomatic pact to us, by which trade and military activities will be easier, and safeguards succession in both countries."

They officially protested against crowning of princess, because Prince James is considered by many as rightful heir to the Enchancian throne, and besides, Sofia is considered by many dukes as a commoner, with no rights to the throne.\n\nAn emergency meeting with royal advisors has been called - what should Queen Sofia do?"
    enchancia.4.a:0 "I won't do what they say!"

Its aim is to bring order and peace in the western part of Central Continent, as wars in EverRealm are becoming more and more common, and expansion of Lord Farquaad is more and more dangerous.\n\nThe declaration was quickly followed by statement from Japanifornian leader [JPN.GetLeader], saying that Lechists are once again wanting to set the Central Continent ablaze, just as 25 years ago, when they lost part of their Empire.\n\nNo matter the statements and who issues them, tensions in the region are certainly rising again, and nobody can guess the outcome of this situation."

Till now.\n\nToday, as news outlets in Japanifornia announced, Lechina Empire has issued a note to Japanifornian leader, [JPN.GetLeader], demanding immediate return of southern Lechinian regions, lost in War of 1912. Lechinian note said, that all other cessions have been declared 'null and void', as they have been returned to the Empire, thus, Japanifornia holds the territory illegally.\n\nNo response has been issued yet, but one thing is sure by now - war between Japanifornia and Lechists is clearly unavoidable now."

    game_start_event.2.d:0 "Flower Hill is a country from North Korean cartoon 'Squirrel and Hedgehog', produced from 1977 to 2013 - since then, it's likely in hiatus, as no new episodes have aired since then.\n\nIn the series, citizens of Flower Hill have to defend themselves from vicious attacks from Weasels (all episodes) and Wolves (newer episodes) as in the older episodes, their defender Bear (also known as Uncle Gom) is shown as unable to protect Flower Hill from harm.\nThere are rumours that characters from Flower Hill represent North Koreans, mice are South Koreans (as they repeatedly search for allies against Flower Hill), Weasels are Japanese, and Wolves are Americans (if you think that's being interpreted as a wolf is bad, watch the series, it's on YouTube. Also Google 'Lt. Fox Vixen', because she basiacally made the series famous on the West.) - this mod drops the whole interpretation thing.\n\nThe situation at the start of the mod is this:\nGeumsaegi, the main character from Flower Hill, has returned from the secret mission in Wolves' Den, together with his brother, two friends, and Dr. Mole. The Squirrel Village, conquered by Wolves some time before Geumsaegi's mission, is still not retaken by Flower Hill. Furthermore - the conquest of Squirrel Village by Wolves, caused massive fall in the Flower Hill High Military Council popularity, and massive escapes from the country were made by its citizens to barren lands on the East, where they created new, democratic countries.\nNow, the situation looks pretty bad - while the further escape attempts were stopped, the country is still divided. To prevent Flower Hill from total downfall, the High Council has passed a resolution allowing elections to the position of Supreme Leader. Will the country rise from the ashes? Will the communism triumph? Time will tell."

Plans of further colonization are being made, considering creation of settlements even on Far East.

The young Crown Prince of Greenland, known also as The Last Dragon, is now forced to defend his country from two sides: the first one being Desert, and the second one being Iceworld ruled by snowman Arktos, who however is obliged not to attack Greenland due to the treaty signed earlier. Another problem is that Greenland doesn't have any industry at all, and with changing times, the country must be transformed as soon as possible.

    starfleet.7.d:0 "While we were busy in our region, the situation in the southern part of the world has rapidly changed.\n\nIn Starfleet Territories, [KPT.GetLeader] won the elections for the Admiral, but this seemingly did not change their situation against the threat from Alien Colony and Sancti Magistri - because today we have received transmission from Starfleet' capital, saying, that they are in dire need of allying with us as soon as it is possible.\n\nGiven current situation and distance between our countries, what will we reply?"

    starfleet.13.d:0 "It seems that the programme of handing out free pizza to everyone in Starfleet did not appease JJ Torpeda, as the captain started to conduct what he calls 'private investigation' on the matter of Free Pizza Programme and Galak Pizza company.\n\nNobody knows if he ever finds something, as there is rumour that..."

    starfleet.14.d:0 "During his investigation, Captain JJ Torpeda found something, that looked like 'something very interesting', as he described recently during his visit to the Colony HQ.

    starfleet.15.d:0 "Our informer said today, that he had searched JJ Torpeda's house and found straight proofs linking Domino Jachaś to Galak Pizza, that might cause an earthquake and scandal in Starfleet. However, this info might be inaccurate, as our informer has been caught by the police while coming out of Torpeda's house and taken into custody, so his memory might be a bit changed...\n\nWhat will Admiral Jachaś do?"

    starfleet.16.d:0 "Sudden arrest of JJ Torpeda, with claims of him being the spy for Sancti Magistri, was big surprise among Starfleet soldiers. The only person happy from this turn of events was Tytus Bomba, because of his rivalry with Torpeda.\n\nHowever, Torpeda's friend and Kurvinox, Michał Głuś, decided to continue the investigation in order to find out who caused the arrest of JJ Torpeda. This, as a result, still poses a danger to Admiral Jachaś... what should he do?"
    starfleet.16.a:0 "He's too stupid, he won't find anything"
    starfleet.16.b:0 "Arrest him! He may be stupid, but he's not THAT stupid!"
    starfleet.161.t:0 "Starfleet Tribunal asks Jachaś why Torpeda and Głuś are in jail"
    starfleet.161.d:0 "Some time passed since Michał Głuś was arrested by the order of Admiral Jachaś, and today Starfleet Tribunal, in light of no official accusation made against the two commanders, asked Admiral Domino Jachaś, why he ordered to arrest JJ Torpeda and Głuś.\n\nIn response, Admiral Jachaś personally arrived to Tribunal's headquarters and requested a hearing before Tribunal the same day.\n\nTribunal once again asked Domino Jachaś about the reason for arrest of Torpeda and Głuś - what will Admiral reply?"
    starfleet.161.a:0 "They were spying for Sancti Magistri"

    starfleet.16131.a:0 "Whew!"
    starfleet.17.t:0 "Michał Głuś finds the proofs!"
    starfleet.17.d:0 "When Michał Głuś broke into Torpeda's house today's evening, he found what he was looking for - the reason why Torpeda was arrested. And proofs for his innocence - the official note proving who is the CEO of Galak Pizza.\n\nHowever, Admiral Jachaś was there first.\nAfter letting Głuś to read the papers and gain knowledge about truth, he confronted him and tried to murder him, but shot himself in the arm with backfiring bullet - Głuś got the upper hand and ran away.\n\nAdmiral, wounded, retreated back to his HQ and ordered Captain Bomba to hunt down Głuś at all costs, as he (Głuś) was 'exposed' as Sancti Magistri's spy."
    starfleet.17.a:0 "What the...?"
    starfleet.18.t:0 "Galak Pizza Scandal"
    starfleet.18.d:0 "After a few days, Bomba came to Admiral's office and asked one question - 'who is the CEO of Galak Pizza?'\n\nJachaś knew that the time has come and decided to get rid of Bomba too.\n\nThe fierce fighting that broke out between Admiral and Captain lasted few minutes, but was enough for the TV crew to film it as a proof that Jachaś embezzled thousands of zlotys to Galak Pizza; Captain Torpeda, who broke out of prison with help of Głuś (who prior informed Bomba about the truth and cooperated with him), explained to everyone what was really happening while whole Starfleet was eating free pizza.\n\nAs a result, Jachaś was thrown into jail for some time for embezzle of Starfleet's money, and Torpeda was sworn as new Admiral.\n\nAnd Captain Bomba still shoots the enemy."
    starfleet.18.a:0 "What a twist!"
    starfleet.19.t:0 "Recruits from Starfleet HQ"
    starfleet.19.d:0 "Today, a transport from Kurvix Galaxy has landed in our colony HQ, which transported several thousand recruits from our home galaxy. They're here to help us fight on this front of war with Sancti Magistri!"
    starfleet.19.a:0 "Great!"
    starfleet.20.t:0 "The war with Humsin"
    starfleet.20.d:0 "Alien Colony has capitulated, however we're still fighting with Humsin, Sancti Magistri's remaining ally. The distance between our territory and their empire is quite big and leading an invasion so far away from our bases would be a suicide, so... maybe we should sign a separate peace with them?"
    starfleet.20.a:0 "A good idea."
    starfleet.21.t:0 "Starfleet wants to sign peace treaty"
    starfleet.21.d:0 "We have received a note from Starfleet HQ in their colony, asking us, if we would like to sign a peace treaty due to current war circumstances - the distance between our countries, possible logistic problems for both of us, and so on.\n\nWhat will we answer?"
    starfleet.21.a:0 "The Sultan was only a problem for us anyway."
    starfleet.21.b:0 "Never! Humsin won't give up!"

    spalding.4.d:0 "Many days passed since Marian Paździoch announced that he will ask Ferdynand Kiepski, leader of 'Hug Me' party, for help concerning Janusz Tracz request. Many people began to doubt that anything will happen, thinking that Paździoch only stalled to gain more time; the fact that contributed to this was that Paździoch and Kiepski don't like each other much.\n\nThis has changed when early afternoon, Kiepski has organised a conference in Alberbuty during his campaign.\nHe told journalists that he has indeed received plea for help from Paździoch, whom he named 'ulcer on healthy organism of our country', and decided, that..."

As it turned out, they belonged to forces led by Janusz Tracz, who personally arrived in his car to witness the raid.\n\nWhen Tracz' men broke into the station HQ, fierce firefight broke out as windows in the upper floors of the building opened up and Paździoch's men opened fire upon the aggressors.\nAfter a short while, another group of trucks arrived, and men, who jumped out of them, immediately opened fire upon Tracz' forces - the voice that commanded them was recognized as the voice of Ferdynand Kiepski himself.\n\nThe three-way fighting lasted for ten minutes, as heavy police forces drove up to the scene and ended the battle, arresting many combatants on scene; only few managed to flee the 'battlefield'.

    spalding.9.d:0 "In the beginning of the mediations, Janusz Tracz has stated outright, that his demand of Paździoch selling his shop to him with low price still stands. In reply, Paździoch said that he won't sell his shop, because he worked very hard to open it as a stallholder. Tracz began to bump the price slightly in order to lure Paździoch into selling the shop, but to no avail - Marian's stance did not change.\n\nAfter an hour of bumping the price, Tracz got angry, rose from his seat and shouted at Paździoch, saying, that if he won't pay in money, he will pay in blood; Marian replied, that his security forces will gladly repel any forces dispatched by Tracz.\n\nThe argument began to be so heated, that Wojtyła had to step in, in order to prevent the fight between two men; he proposed that Tracz should pay true price of the shop - much higher than Tracz proposed - and Paździoch should sell it.\n\nWith atmosphere so heated, the outcome of this situation was..."

Marian Paździoch returned to his shop, and started his party proper election campaign, however it is not known if he will change the difference between his and Kiepski's party.\n\nCardinal Wojtyła was praised for his deeds, and, beside Hug Me and Prawo i Pięść parties, is considered serious candidate in the coming elections."

When they double checked the maps, it turned out it's not present on any of them, even on those made a few months earlier.\nWhen the team entered the house (or, rather, the hut), there was only young man in his early twenties inside - as soldiers came in, he rose from his seat, came to them and asked what do they want. The commander of the unit drew a small reprint of Winslow Royal Family painting, and quickly realized, who that young man was.\n\nThey found Prince James Winslow!\n\nContrary to soldiers' joy, the prince wasn't rather happy that he was found, even if the dictatorship that ruled Enchancia for past years has been dismantled.\nWhen asked, what was happening with him, his sisters and mother after the war, he did not want to talk about it. After short thinking, the commander decided that they have to transport Prince James to Dunwiddie in order to meet with [ROOT.GetLeader] and to get the truth out of him, much to Prince' opposition; however, his objection was not considered by anyone present.\n\nAs the unit traveled through Enchancia, which was once again rebuilding itself from recent conquest, the news of recent findings quickly spread throughout the country; when the group got off the train in Dunwiddie, hundreds of citizens greeted their Prince, whom they did not see or hear since the civil war ended.\n\nThe same day, Prince James, once again in his royal suit, met with our leader, [ROOT.GetName], and told the whole truth about the darkest period in Enchancian history.\n\nAfter former dictatorship government decided to strip all titles from Winslows, they firstly moved to Miranda's former shop in Dunwiddie; she bravely fought to earn money in the old way of shoemaking and get food for her kids, but fanatical supporters of the regime quickly butchered her attempts to live normal life - one day, Miranda did not return home, and new government - nor local, nor top - cared about her. As a result, the shop was closed, and royal siblings travelled to different parts of the country. James last saw princesses Amber and Sofia in Dunwiddie, when he was being relocated to an orphanage in Sardinnoza; after his 17th birthday, he began fishing, and moved out of the city in order to live out the rest of his life in peace.\n\nThen, Prince James said, that he did not want to return and claim the throne back after what happened, but after seeing people greeting him on the station, he reconsidered that, and agreed to take Enchancian throne."
